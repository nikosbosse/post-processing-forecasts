## Motivation:<br>UK Covid-19 Crowd Forecasting Challenge

]

- Predict Number of Covid-19 Cases and Deaths for the next 4 weeks in the United Kingdom

--

- Submission of weekly predictions via an interactive web application

--

- Part of ongoing research project by the **epiforecasts** group at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine where our project supervisor Nikos Bosse is engaged as a doctoral candidate

]

- Idea: Compare forecasts from humans with model-based predictions

--

- Empirically human forecasts are surprisingly competitive and in some cases even better than statistical models 

--

- This is mostly true for **point** forecasts, prediction **intervals** are often chosen too narrow, i.e. humans tend to be too confident in their own predictions

--

- Goal: Use valuable information from point forecasts and adjust prediction intervals / quantile forecasts with an appropriate correction procedure

# Post Processing 

---

## Idea

- Adjust Forecasts based on performance metrics for out-of-sample data

--

-  Split in 3 separate data sets:

    - **Training:** Build quantile predictions model
    - **Validation:** Determine hyperparameters of post-processing method
    - **Test:** Evaluate adjusted predictions
  
--
    
- **Important:** In our project we do **not** build a prediction model, we merely adjust forecasts of existing ones.

## Methods
#Many post-processing methods available, including
#<!--M: I wouldn't discuss the methods in detail. An example intorduction is done later when we talk about CQR.
#Either go over the slide fast or ommit it and add a bullet point with the three methods to the slide before + #Verlinkung zum Repository-->
#--
#
#- **Conformalized Quantile Regression**: <br>
#  Focus of Today
#
#--
#
#- **Quantile Regression Averaging**: <br>
#  For given quantile level $\alpha$, new prediction is a weighted average of multiple existing predictions from #different models. 
#    The oindividual contributions, i.e. the weights, are chosen to minimize a custom loss function.
#    
#--
#
#- **Quantile Spread Adjustment**: <br>
#  Assumes multiplicative relationship between quantile levels, e.g. $q_{0.9} = \lambda_{0.9} \cdot q_{0.8} = #\lambda_{0.8} \cdot q_{0.8}$ with potentially different factors $\lambda_{\alpha}$. <br>
#  Too conservative quantile predictions can thus be corrected by choosing larger multiplicative factors in the #tails of the predictive distribution. 
#<!--the indices of the multiplication looks wrong here.-->

## Evaluation

- Based on **Weighted Interval Score**<sup>1</sup>  

.center.bold[WIS = Sharpness + Underprediction + Overprediction]

.footnote[[1] https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008618]

--

  - For a given quantile level $\alpha$, true observed value $y$ as well as lower bound $l$ and upper bound $u$ of the corresponding $(1 - \alpha) \cdot 100$% prediction interval, the score is computed as

$$
Score_\alpha(y) = (u-l) + \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (l-y) \cdot \mathbf{1} (y \leq l) + \frac{2}{\alpha} \cdot (y-u) \cdot \mathbf{1}(y \geq u)
$$

--

- The Score of the entire model can be obtained from a weighted sum over all (included) quantile levels $\alpha$  

--

- Implemented in the .mono[**scoringutils**] R package written by Nikos

# Conformalized Quantile Regression

## Conformalized Quantile Regression

Theory based on Paper Romano Y., Patterson E., and Candès E. (2019): *Conformalized Quantile Regression*

**Central Theorem:** 

If $(X_i, Y_i), i = 1, \ldots, n+1$ are exchangeable, then the $(1 - \alpha) \cdot 100$% prediction interval $C(X_{n+1})$ constructed by the CQR algorithm satisfies
  
$$
\begin{aligned}
P \left(Y_{n+1} \in C(X_{n+1}) \right) \geq 1 - \alpha \quad \text{(coverage)}.
\end{aligned}
$$
Moreover, if the conformity scores $E_i$ are almost surely distinct, then the prediction interval is nearly perfectly calibrated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
P \left( Y_{n+1} \in C(X_{n+1}) \right) \leq 1 - \alpha + \frac{ 1}{ \left| I_2 \right| + 1} \quad \text{(precision)}.
\end{aligned}
$$

---

## CQR Algorithm

**Step 1:** <br>
Split the data into a training and validation (here called *calibration*) set, indexed by $I_1$ and $I_2$, respectively

--

**Step 2:** <br>
For a given quantile $\alpha$ and a given quantile regression algorithm $\mathcal{A}$, calculate lower and upper interval bounds on the training set:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left\{ \hat{ q}_{\alpha, low}, \; \hat{ q}_{\alpha, high} \right\} \leftarrow \mathcal{A} \left( \left\{ (X_i, Y_i): i \in I_1 \right\} \right) 
\end{aligned}
$$

--

**Step 3:** <br>
Compute **conformity scores** on the calibration set:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E_i := \operatorname*{max} \left\{ \hat{ q}_{\alpha, low}(X_i) - Y_i, \; Y_i - \hat{ q}_{\alpha, high}(X_i) \right\} \quad \forall \; i \in I_2
\end{aligned}
$$

For each $i$, the corresponding score $E_i$ is **positive** if $Y_i$ is **outside** the interval $\left[ \hat{ q}_{\alpha, low}(X_i), \; \hat{ q}_{\alpha, high}(X_i) \right]$ and **negative** if $Y_i$ is **inside** the interval.

---

## CQR Algorithm

**Step 4:** <br>
Compute the **margin** $Q_{1 - \alpha}(E, I_2)$ given by the $(1 - \alpha)(1 + \frac{ 1}{ 1 + \left| I_2 \right| })$-th empirical quantile of the scores $E_i$ in the calibration set.

--

**Step 5:** <br>
On the basis of the original prediction interval bounds $\hat{ q}_{\alpha, low}(X_i)$ and $\hat{ q}_{\alpha, high}(X_i)$, the new *post-processed* prediction interval for $Y_i$ is given by

$$
\begin{aligned}
C(X_{n+1}) = \left[ \hat{ q}_{\alpha,  low}(X_i) - Q_{1 - \alpha}(E, I_2), \; \hat{ q}_{\alpha,  high}(X_i) + Q_{1 - \alpha}(E, I_2) \right].
\end{aligned}
$$

--

- Note that the **same** margin is subtracted/added for the lower and upper bound, which limits the flexibility

--

- Possible extensions could use different margins and/or **multiplicative** correction terms

## Core Idea

- Structured and unifying framework for implementing various post-processing techniques

--

- Aims to establish a consistent workflow for a collection of post-processing methods
<!-- supported by an intuitive user interface  -->

--

- Allows for convenient comparisons between methods for the data of interest
<!-- and the choice of the best method -->

## Time Series Cross-Validation

.footnote[https://otexts.com/fpp3/tscv.html]

.left-35[

- Time series cross-validation iterates through the data along the time dimension

- At each time point the test set is composed of the one step ahead prediction

- The algorithm typically starts with a minimum number of observation as the initial training set

## Update and Evaluate Forecasts for a fixed time horizon

<!-- M: If possible I would like to add a slide identical to the one using cross validation but with pure training with the cqr method to highlight the contrast to the time series cross validation -->

<!-- M: can the code chunk and the table be put on the right so that we can add bullet points to the slide? -->

<!-- M: bullet points:

- The interval score for the validation set is slightly worse after applying the CQR method

- This result holds in the aggregate over all horizons and quantiles

# What's next?

## Many possible directions 

- Extension / Refinement of the CQR Method as well as the implementation of further Post-Processing methods

--

- Analysis of method performances in relationship characteristics such as the sample size, forecast horizon, interval width and prediction model

--

- Construct new Post-Processing method as Ensemble Model of individual processing techniques
